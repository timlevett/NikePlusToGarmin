NikePlusToGarmin
================

This project's goal is to provide a conversion tool from a Nike Plus GPS run to a format accepted by endomondo.  

This uses the nikeplus rest api (http://developer.nike.com/)

This is also going to use the GPX standard to generate the .gpx xml file using the waypoints.
